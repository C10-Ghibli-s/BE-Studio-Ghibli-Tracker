# BE-Studio-Ghibli-Traker
Studio Ghibli Tracker is a web application that allows us to view the catalog of films produced by Studio Ghibli, as well as register a personal rating and keep track of which ones you have already seen and which ones you have not yet.

This project is done by implemeting the nest JS framework in order to create an API REST capable to respond the resquest from the client side. Resquests like OAuth authentication with username, facebook login, twitter login, create an user, restore his password, change it too; and implement a CRUD for the entities from the Database.

## The DataBase Modeling
---
We identify seven entities from studio ghibli tracker. They are users, movies, titles, interactions, writers, directors and musicians, only two of them are strong entites which are users and movies; the other ones are weak entities. In the next picture is shown the ER diagram and the relationship that entities have each other.

With this driagram in mind we are able to create the physical diagram with the types of data for each attribute of the entities in the DataBase, in the following image you can see it, also it contains the foreign keys and contraints of the models.
